# Data-Science-Projects--Master-s-Degree-in-DS
My projects for my Master's Degree in Data Science :) 

This repository will group the projects I submitted for my exam for the Statistical Learning course. I am attending the master's degree in Data Science at Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II. 
Statistical Analysis and ML has been the topics of this course.
I have worked on two projects:
- PREDICTION OF FISH WEIGHT BY USING A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL WITH 7 DIFFERENT SPECIES OF FISH 
- PREDICTION OF A CLIENT TERM DEPOSIT ON BANK MARKETING DATA

In this repository you will find different files:
- the file fish.csv that is the data set for the first analysis
- the .pdf file that is the report for the statistical analysis of the prediction for the fish weight
- the .Rmd that is the statistical analysis conducted in R of the Fish.csv data set
- the .ppt file for the presentation of the first project 
- the file banking_mktg.ipynb that is the python notebook in colab for the analysis of the second project
- the second .ppt for the presentation of the aboce work
